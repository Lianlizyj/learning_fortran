Structure
text101 18
This information is used by the grid generators.

In Carre, it limits the grid in both poloidal and radial directions.
According to Carre conventions, the structure consists of several
SEPARATE pieces. Those intersecting the actual separatrix branches
("targets") must be closed, and every separatrix branch must intersect
a target. Targets limit the grid poloidally and radially: every magnetic
surface used for the grid must either be closed (the core region) or
intersect two targets (SOL/PFR). Other parts of the structure, if present,
can be either open or closed. They limit the grid radially.

In Sonnet, the structure is only used for visualization (the outer part
of the Structure is shadowed in the PostScript output file). It must be
closed and single-connected.

Note that unmarked elements have no effect on the structure (e. g., an
unmarked element is a valid separator for the pieces of structure in the
Carre mode).

This layer contains variables which are only used for grid generation.
The specification of the Structure depends on the output mode (Carre
vs. Sonnet).
In the Sonnet mode, the Structure must be a singly-connected closed polygon.

In the Carre mode, the Structure must consist of several parts.

Those intersecting the separatrix branches (the target structures) must be
closed, and every one of them must intersect only one branch.

Other pieces of the Structure (limiting structures) can be either open or
closed.
Every piece of structure must be disconnected from the others.

Only the marked elements count here!

The "regions of influence" for the divides are:
  - poloidal (targets): divertor region for
    each target;
  - poloidal: outer SOL for outer edge;
      PFR for PFR edge; inside the main
      separatrix for core.
Divides outside these regions are ignored.

Limiter configuration

VarDefs102 8
Help
Help
text101 50
This gives you a way - although a clumsy one - to treat a limiter
configurations. The problem is that DG in its present state cannot produce
correct output files if no x-points is specified, so that one has to cheat
the code somehow. The temporary solution realised with this set of
variables works in the following way.

(1) Import a fake single-null equilibrium. The best would be something of a
very different size, so that it lies completely outside the geometry you
really want to model. Import the single-null topology. Create a surface in
the core region as usual - although its position does not affect anything.

(2) Create two closed polygons acting as the targets for the fake single-
null equilibrium.

(3) Add a "Limiter configuration" variable, and cut and paste the name of
the limiter equilibrium file into the "Real equilibrium" there. Specify some
reasonable value for the "Core width".

(4) Create a "Structure" which contains the two fake SN targets - see p.(2),
plus the one representing the limiter, plus some grid-limiting parts if
needed. Use the fake targets as the "Inner target" and "Outer target" in
the "Structure".

(5) Specify the target properties as usual with the "Target specification"
variables. These refer to the parts of the limiter on both sides of the
plasma. "Target #1" and "Target #2" should be positioned so that you travel
clockwise around the plasma when going from "Target #1" to "Target #2".
Use the real elements you want to be reconnected to the grid corners as
the "SOL edges". For the "PFR edges", create two fake elements and specify
0 as the "Surface Type" in the "General Surface Data" for these two elements.
They must not be included in the "Elements not for Eirene" list.

(6) Create the "Surfaces" and "Grid points" as usual. Only the "Core" zone
for the "Grid points" and the "SOL" and "Core" areas for the "Surfaces" are
meaningful.

(7) In "Global Eirene data", make sure that the "Major radius" is set to
its real positive value.

(8) Follow the usual procedure: create output, do "lns", go to "carre" and
create the grid, import the grid and look at it. You will have to play with
the usual settings for the grid generation, such as the "Surfaces" and
"Grid points" together with the "Carre guard length" in the
"Target specifications", and also with the "Core width" in the "Limiter
configuration" in order to get the grid which suits you and is acceptable
for the plasma modelling code (no pink segments in the grid). If you find
it impossible to create the necessary distribution of the surfaces or the
grid points because of local extrema appearing on the visualisation curve,
then try to adjust the "Radial scale" or "Poloidal scale" in the "Limiter
configuration" layer.

Here you specify the data for evaluation of wall erosion for
different wall materials. The evaluation can be done in a stand-
alone Eirene run through a call to the diagnostic routine "diag2".
If this specification is present in the DG output file, then uinp
will create a separate Eirene input file called "diag2.eir" which
can be used for the standalone diagnostic run.

Instead of the real wall, where the plasma fluxes are not determined
in B2-Eirene, the diag2 routine calculates the neutral fluxes and
spectra at every cell face along the outer grid edge. After this, it
uses these data, together with the plasma ion fluxes, to calculate
the gross and net erosion at each cell face. The material properties
of the grid edge are taken from the specified "material templates".
The erosion/deposition balance of the wall material will be produced.
An extra material, erosion of which should also be calculated, can
be specified in "Extra material".

Multiple material templates can be specified, and for each of them,
one or two (if the extra material is specified) output files will be
created, containing the data on the erosion of specified materials
from a surface of certain properties exposed to the neutral and ion
fluxes expected at the very edge of the plasma.

Here you specify "ties" between the grid edge and wall segments for the
erosion-deposition diagnostics.

The problem is that in Eirene, the neutral data are calculated on the wall
segments ("additional surfaces") whereas the ion related data are taken at
the grid edge. The diagnostic routine DIAG2 calculates the neutral fluxes
at the grid edge, but (presently) only for the hydrogen isotopes which are
subject to charge exchange. This approach fails in the regions where the
deposition is neutral-dominated, e.g. in the PFR.

In order to combine the expected erosion and deposition caused by both
ions and neutrals, one has to tell the code, which wall segments
correspond to each grid edge segment in question. You have to create a
variable of this kind for each grid edge segment you need.

Tied cell
text101 4
Here you specify the segment of the grid edge to be tied to the wall.
Mark a center of a cell close to the desirable location. The poloidal
position of the markers specifies the segment, and its location with
respect to the separatrix selects either the outer or a PFR boundary.

Here you can specify the selection criteria for visualisation of the
surface properties in Eirene. The surfaces affected are all "additional
surfaces" which are not invalidated through either "Elements not for
Eirene" in DG or by the ADDUSR routine, and the "non-default standard
surfaces" corresponding to the recycling strata.

At the begining of the Eirene run, a data file with coordinates of the
end points of the segments where these data are set will be created for
every combination of the values of the selected variables found in the
Eirene input data. These files can then be used for plotting the surfaces
in different colours, e.g. with gnuplot. The files are created either in
the directory ./Eirvsp if it exists, or in the directory where the Eirene
is started.

Several different sets of criteria ("views") can be specified. Look into
the routine "srfprvsl" in Eirene for the file naming conventions.

A criterion is selected if a nonzero value is assigned to it in this
form. The values set here do not affect the parameter values specified
for Eirene!

The data for triangular mesh generated by TRIA code.
The index of the polygon for TRIA and global desired side length for
triangular mesh.

The elements with the same index are grouped into polygons which limit the
triangular mesh.

Positive index means that the triangular mesh should be outside this
polygon, and negative that it must be inside. The absolute values of the
index are supposed to make a full sequence, starting from 1, no repetitions.

0 means that this element is not used for TRIA (default).

Index
text101 15
The index of the polygon for TRIA mesh generation.

The elements with the same index are grouped into polygons which limit the
triangular mesh. If a polygon is not closed, it must end at the elements
marked as "Target edges" or "SOL|PFR edge" in the "Target specification".
In this case, the polygon will be closed using the grid edge.

Positive index means that the triangular mesh should be outside this
polygon, and negative that it must be inside. The absolute values of the
index are supposed to make a full sequence, starting from 1, no repetitions.

0 means that this element is not used for TRIA (default).

Use the "Compare|Find equal" feature (right-click on the value field) to
check the index assignments.
